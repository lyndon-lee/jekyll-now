##Informtion and transformation##
1. We always get information from our teachers including data,knowledge and so on. But we haven't learnt how to transform it.(change the shape of forum)
2. Commen sense is not commen
3. Subtraction is easier than addtion
4. Find the David inside
5. Sometimes the limitation of showing our potention is the influence from the believment of the knowledge we have learnt


**one case**

This is Michelangelo.
One day he was asked by a journalist of his time, "how did you create this most amazing masterpiece, David?", to which Michelangelo responded, "it was easy. I went to the quarry. I saw this huge piece of marble. And in it I saw David. All I needed to do was to chip away the excess stone, to get rid of the marble that shouldn't have been there.
Subtraction is easier than addtion

**What's happiness about**
It's about chipping away the excess stone. It's about getting rid of limitations, of barriers, whether it's the fear of failure, something that we didn't have as kids. But today most people in our culture have it. It's about chipping away perfectionism that is debilitating and often hurts us. It's about chipping away our ability for success, because maybe we are afraid of success. Maybe we feel guilty about some of the things that we have in our life, and that in turn limits us. Maybe it's about chipping away the limitations on our relationships in while we don't thrive within them.
